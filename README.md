# Basic-Personal-Portfolio-Website
This is a basic personal portfolio I made for a lab assignment.

(IMPORTANT NOTE ALL THE CSS STYLING IS EMBEDDED IN THE HEAD OF EACH HTML FILE)
This was meant to be an introduction to CSS but I had already dabbled in web development in the semester prior and like front end development quite a bit so I went just a little overboard. 

This is still pretty basic as far as websites can go in my opinion but considering it was only a 3 hour lab and we were not allowed to use js (to force us to learn the intricacies of CSS),
I would say it's still pretty neat.

It has a nice clean look, and interactice elements scattered out through all the webpages. Feel free to explore!!
